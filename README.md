# ansible-cortex

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drewstinnett/ansible-cortex.svg?branch=master)

## Description

Deploy an instance of Cortex, the free, open source observable analysis engine from TheHive Project.  This Ansible script deploys the code from [TheHive Project](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex).

**Note**: this script is not compatible with Cortex 2.

**DEPRECATING**: Now that the folks at [TheHive Project](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex) have RPM/DEB packages, you are better off using those.  Will keep this repository up for a while in case folks need to look back at it.
